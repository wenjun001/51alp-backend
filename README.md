# 51 ALP backend 

This is a  51ALP backend restful API.

## How to Run


Cluster Model (run on Docker Container)

Build Docker images

mvn install dockerfile:build

Firstly run  mysql image

docker run -p3306:3306 --name mysql -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=wma -d mysql

Secondly run our app

docker run -p 8080:8080 --link mysql:mysql  -t 51alp-backend





Single Model

This application is packaged as a war which has Tomcat 8 embedded. No Tomcat or JBoss installation is necessary. You run it using the ```java -jar``` command.

* Clone this repository 
* Make sure you are using JDK 1.8 and Maven 3.x
* You can build the project and run the tests by running ```mvn clean package```
* Once successfully built, you can run the service by one of these two methods:
```
        java -jar -Dspring.profiles.active=test target/51alp-backend-0.0.1.war
or
        mvn spring-boot:run -Drun.arguments="spring.profiles.active=test"
```
* Check the stdout or boot_example.log file to make sure no exceptions are thrown

Once the application runs you should see something like this

```
2017-08-30 17:31:23.091  INFO 19387 --- [           main] s.b.c.e.t.TomcatEmbeddedServletContainer : Tomcat started on port(s): 8080 (http)
2017-08-30 17:31:23.097  INFO 19387 --- [           main] com.khoubyari.example.Application        : Started Application in 22.285 seconds (JVM running for 23.032)
```

## About the Service

The service is 51 ALP app REST service. 
More interestingly, you can start calling some of the operational endpoints (see full list below) like ```/metrics``` and ```/health``` (these are available on **port 8091**)

You can use this sample service to understand the conventions and configurations that allow you to create a DB-backed RESTful service. Once you understand and get comfortable with the sample app you can add your own services following the same patterns as the sample service.
 
Here is what this little application demonstrates: 

* Full integration with the latest **Spring** Framework: inversion of control, dependency injection, etc.
* Packaging as a single war with embedded container (tomcat 8): No need to install a container separately on the host just run using the ``java -jar`` command
* Demonstrates how to set up healthcheck, metrics, info, environment, etc. endpoints automatically on a configured port. Inject your own health / metrics info with a few lines of code.
* Writing a RESTful service using annotation: supports both XML and JSON request / response; simply use desired ``Accept`` header in your request
* Exception mapping from application exceptions to the right HTTP response with exception details in the body
* *Spring Data* Integration with JPA/Hibernate with just a few lines of configuration and familiar annotations. 
* Automatic CRUD functionality against the data source using Spring *Repository* pattern
* Demonstrates MockMVC test framework with associated libraries
* All APIs are "self-documented" by Swagger2 using annotations 


### To view Swagger 2 API docs

Run the server and browse to localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html


Here are some endpoints you can call:

### Get information about system health, configurations, etc.

```
http://localhost:8091/env
http://localhost:8091/health
http://localhost:8091/info
http://localhost:8091/metrics
```

### Create a video resource

```
POST /v1/videos
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json


RESPONSE: HTTP 201 (Created)
Location header: http://localhost:8080/v1/videos/1
```

### Retrieve a paginated list of videos

```
http://localhost:8080/v1/videos?page=0&size=10

Response: HTTP 200
Content: paginated list 
```

### Update a video resource

```
PUT /v1/videos/1
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json


RESPONSE: HTTP 204 (No Content)
```


# Supported By Spring Boot

Spring Boot is an "opinionated" application bootstrapping framework that makes it easy to create new RESTful services (among other types of applications). It provides many of the usual Spring facilities that can be configured easily usually without any XML. In addition to easy set up of Spring Controllers, Spring Data, etc. Spring Boot comes with the Actuator module that gives the application the following endpoints helpful in monitoring and operating the service:

**/metrics** Shows “metrics” information for the current application.

**/health** Shows application health information.

**/info** Displays arbitrary application info.

**/configprops** Displays a collated list of all @ConfigurationProperties.

**/mappings** Displays a collated list of all @RequestMapping paths.

**/beans** Displays a complete list of all the Spring Beans in your application.

**/env** Exposes properties from Spring’s ConfigurableEnvironment.

**/trace** Displays trace information (by default the last few HTTP requests).

BTW debug

mvn spring-boot:run -Drun.jvmArguments="-Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=y,address=5005"
